#### The objective of this project is to use historical loan application data to Visualize which applicants are able to repay the loans.


### Dataset:

The dataset ultilized for this financial project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data).


## Contents of the Report:

1. Client
2. Application
3. Credit Bureau
4. Credit Card Balance
5. Previous Application


### Phase of Work:
I used a variety of graphs and visualization to forecast Home Credit clients' repayment capacities in order to determine how capable each application is of repaying a loan. Home Credit presently uses a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques to get these predictions, but I have generated similar predictions using Power BI.
By doing this, lenders may prevent clients who can pay back loans from being turned away and can give out loans with principal, maturities, and repayment schedules that will help borrowers succeed.


## Client

The report below includes demographic data regarding the clients' yearly income, whether they own cars, and the number of dependents they have.

Here, we can observe that the majority of the applicants for loans are employees. Only 2% of the clients either live in a rented apartment or with their parents, and about 67 percent of those who sought for loans were female.


## Application

This report details the number of customers who applied for loans this year and last year, together with the date and time of their applications.

According to both figures, the majority of customers came in for loans on Tuesday around 10 am, while the least number of customers came in on a Sunday.

As we can see, the average current debt is 137K, while the largest amount past due is 116M. Clients have taken out 54 percent of the 63 percent of closed credit activity in consumer loans.

According to the figure above, 18.54 billion of the 28.5 billion dollars that were pulled in the previous month came through atms. 9.2 billion were drawn to purchase products. and the remaining 890 million were drawn for rest.

According to this survey, almost 73.73 percent of the clients were return customers. Around 747K was paid via revolving cash, and the majority of client rejections were attributable to XAP.
